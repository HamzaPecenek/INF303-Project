# Bone Knight - A 2D Pixel Art Platform Game

## Main Premise and Story

The player is a dead knight, who has no memory of who they were once. They pick up a new name and a personality and try to figure out where they are, who they are and what they want to do.

The place they woke up seems to be a forest of lush greens and vibrant foliage. The trees are ancient, and the waters are crisp (color theme is deep greens and teals to reflect that, and we need separate tree sprites to get the feeling right), however, there are not many signs of other livelihoods. No animal sounds or animal sprites.

The player tells themselves it is peaceful but why do they feel so heavy and battered. We lead the player to a nearby water (lake, ofc there will be stone platforms to cross it after the cutscene) and they realize they are not human. At least not anymore. They see a rusty armor, and behind the visor of the helmet, there are just faint lights, glimmering. They remove the helmet to see how they look, to have a clue who they might have been, only to realize they are only bones.

One thing the player doesn't know is they are not the skeleton, but the armor. Once they realize their bones are mostly freely juggling around the armor, they come to the realization that they are most likely a bound soul on that rusty armor. They don't know why.

### The Truth (Developer Knowledge)

As the devs, we know that the player is dead. They committed many atrocities under the name of their lord against the forest, so their soul is rejected by the land itself. However, it is heavy with guilt and shame, therefore it could not fade away either. So now it is bound to the armor that helped them to commit all those sins against the land itself.

## Environment

### The Land

The forest, or the land this knight was supposed to take over for their lord, is a place which is a sanctuary for souls, fairies and all kinds of mythical creatures. Its trees bear memories of souls and roots carry the fallen. Brimming with divine power, land's existence threatens the tyrannical and paranoid lord.

### Key Areas

**Mushroom Forest**

- Almost all members were once our subordinates
- The ones who were remorseful now became these little mushroom people and live under the ancient mushroom's guidance
- Mostly no memories of their previous lives

**Land of Bones**

- Where our little army was wiped out by the forest itself
- Soil still red with blood, covered with bones and rusted metals
- Its residence is the monsters created with guilt and shame

**Land of Truth**

- The deepest part of the forest, where the player will finish the game
- Contains the sapling of rebirth, letting players choose what they want to do
- Endgame area
- Visited twice:
  - First visit: Around middle of the story (60% completion), guides players for remaining part
  - Second visit: At the end (possibly includes a section to save this sapling from destruction)

### Ending Choices

The sapling asks the player after completing the story, who they want to be:

- Are they going to continue living as they are now?
- Do they want to be born with this new identity?
- Are they going to be a part of the forest?
